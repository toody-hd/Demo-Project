# Demo-Project
This project was created with WPF (XAML) and C# using MVVM and INI to store data.
The project was Created using Visual Studio 2017 and .NET Framework 4.6.1 on Windows 10 64-bit.

IMPORTANT : The user is "Admin" and the password is "passx"

This project was mainly created for my personal usage and because I'm passionate about learn more of C# and XAML.
Descriptions of the project:
The project main function is to keep record of some of you important programs or files. What exactly does it do?
You add any program that you want, you choose a name for it and a picture, so it looks nice and neat,
and if this program has like and upcoming date of update, you can just set it up and the program will let you know when that day has come,
reminding you that you need to update your important program.

IMPORTANT : To add a new important program to the data, you need to complete every field, 
            including adding a picture (the picture can be added by using drag-drop or by clicking the image field).

This program has many cool features like searching through your important programs or filtering them, and yes,
you can also exclude programs from filtering ( but this is and Easter egg, you have to find it ;) ).
It also support four languages, for now (English, German, Romanian and Japanese), why Japanese you ask?
Because I am also passionate of learning Japanese language.

If you are still reading this then you must really like what you read, so here are some more cool features that this program has: 
  -When you right click an already existing program, you will see the edit panel of that program.
  -If you click it, then this will run the executable link that was found recorded to this program 
  (basically if you imputed the link to your program will execute that program).
  -If you double-click it, it will run the web-link registered to this program.
  -And finally if you middle-mouse-click, you can delete this program from the data (A prompt message will ask you if you are sure).
